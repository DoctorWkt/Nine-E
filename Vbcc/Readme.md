Here is what I'm using as config files and targets for the `vbcc` compiler.
You probably don't need the `include` and `lib` directories, but I've included
them just in case.

You can get the `vbcc` compiler from here: http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html

You will need to install the `vbcc` compiler, the `vasm` assembler and the `vlink`
linker, all built for the 6809. Once installed, copy the `config` and `targets`
directories into where you installed the `vbcc` compiler.
